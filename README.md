# Predictive-Analysis-for-Manufacturing-Operations
Predictive analysis API for manufacturing operations using machine learning. The API predicts machine downtime or defects based on input data like temperature and run time. Built with Flask, it supports file uploads for training, model evaluation, and real-time predictions with confidence scores.
# Overview
This project implements a Predictive Analysis Model to predict machine downtime or production defects in a manufacturing environment. It uses a simple machine learning model (Decision Tree) and exposes a RESTful API to interact with the model for training and making predictions.

# Features:
Upload Dataset: Upload a CSV file containing manufacturing data.
Train Model: Train a machine learning model using the uploaded dataset.
Predict Downtime: Make predictions based on new data inputs.
